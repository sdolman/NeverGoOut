<h1>Shakespeare's Sonnet #18</h1>

<br>

<p>Intro text: this is one his most famous.</p>

<ul>
<li>Shall I compare thee to a summer's day? </li>
<li>Thou art more lovely and more temperate:</li>
<li>Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,</li>
<li>And summer's lease hath all too short a date: </li>
<li>Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,</li>
<li>And often is his gold complexion dimm'd; </li>
<li>And every fair from fair sometime declines,</li>
<li>By chance, or nature's changing course, untrimm'd;</li>
<li>But thy eternal summer shall not fade</li>
<li>Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow'st;</li>
<li>Nor shall Death brag thou wander'st in his shade,</li>
<li>When in eternal lines to time thou grow'st; </li>
<li>So long as men can breathe or eyes can see,</li>
<li>So long lives this, and this gives life to thee. </li>
</ul>
